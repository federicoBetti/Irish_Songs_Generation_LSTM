# ANN_MiniProject2
The aim of the project was to generate new Irish Folk songs after having trained different time of recurrent neural networks (RNN, GRU, LSTM) on an Irish folk songs dataset. Lot of preprocessing was required to provide appropriate input to the network. Nice results were achieved, they can be listened in GRU_Generaed_Melodies.
